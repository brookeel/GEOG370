    <h1>Map Projections (by Brooke Elliott)</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">How to display a map in different projections using QGIS:</h2>
    <p>To display the world in different projections, I downloaded a shapefile from the internet that displayed the nations of the world. Files like these can be found at naturalearthdata.com.
        After downloading the provided shapefile showing Earth's countries and continents, I converted the map into different projections using the tool in the bottom right corner of the QGIS interface.
        This tool allows you to change the projection (a.k.a. area, distortion, and shape) of the map you're working with. I also downloaded a plugin called the "indicatrix mapper," which uses circles
        to show how different maps distort distance, area, and shape to depict the spheroid Earth on a flat plane. </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 Projection is "equirectangular," meaning that the lines on which the indicatrix circles lie create rectangles of equal size. "WGS" stands for "World Geodetic System" and is the basis 
    for our Global Positioning System (GPS). As indicated by the distortions of the indicatrixes, this map distorts closer to the poles, becoming vertically squished and horizontally stretched.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>In sharp contrast to the equirectangular WGS84 Projection, the Aitoff Projection uses curved latitudinal and longitudinal lines, turning the world map into an oval. This projection is equal-area,
        meaning that the original area of the continents of the world is preserved even if their shapes are distorted. The most notable distortion occurs at the left and right edges of the map, as seen in 
        the elongated circles (now ovals) of that area.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This familiar-looking map is the standard for web mapping applications like Google Earth. The latitudinal and longitudinal lines of this map are straightened,
	and the indicatrix circles show that shape is completely preserved while area increases drastically near the poles. In this projection, Greenland is about the same
	size of Africa, even though Greenland is about 1/14th the size of Africa in real life.</h3>

<h2>Winkel Tripel Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Winkel Tripel Projection was adopted as standard by the National Geographic Society in 1998, and it remains almost as popular as maps like the Mercator Projection. This
	map is a compromise between the Aitoff and Equirectangular Projections, creating an oval shape with a flattened top and bottom. This map creates a balance between
	shape and area distortion; the greatest distortion occurs near the upper and lower corners of this map. </h3>

<h2>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map represents the spheroid Earth on a flat plane by projecting points on the Earth's surface onto a "cylinder" that wraps the Earth. This map preserves area, but vertically
	squishes the shape of continents as they near the poles. Due to this compression of shape that still preserves area, this particular map projection is long and rectangular. </h3>

    </a>

<h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map represents the spheroid Earth on a flat plane in a triangular shape, as the Earth's points are projected onto a cone. The shape and area of countries and continents are 
	preserved near the north pole, but heavily distorted near the south pole. This style of map is often used for maps of smaller countries and preserves distances across all meridians. </h3>

<h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This circular map represents the Earth from the perspective of the North Pole, creating heavy horizontal stretching and area increases on lands near the South Pole. As its name
	implies, this map is primarily used for polar regions (as well as some northern air and land travel). This map projection is also the emblem used by the United Nations. </h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Sinusoidal Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Sinusoidal Projection shares some traits with maps like the Aitoff Projection, using curved latitudinal and longitudinal lines and a rounded canvas for their map. However, the
	Sinusoidal Projection is pseudocylindrical, creating a pointed shape at the top and bottom. Despite the heavy shape distortion at the corners of this map, it is actually an equal area
	map, meaning that the area of each country is preserved. </h3>

<h2>South Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This circular map represents the Earth from the perspective of the South Pole, creating heavy horizontal stretching and area increases on lands near the North Pole. As its name
	implies, this map is primarily used to chart and travel in the southernmost regions of the Earth. </h3>
